To run this program, open up a terminal at the directory containing the two code files, and

run : python3 interface.py 
(or whichever python version - if it is compatible with the code files).

NOTE : don't rely on this encryptor for any serious secret business. The ceasars cypher might
be broken quite easily, since its just letter positions being shifted 1 place or upto 26 places.
