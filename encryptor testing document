    1   launch program                  CLEAR       the program launches to main menu
    
    2   program exit                    CLEAR       main menu quit option works
    
    
    3   cancelling encryption           CLEAR       cancelling inputting of key was alright.
        (or decryption)
                                                    cancelling encryption of the text did not work
                                                    to enter, had to input 'c', but 'c' was taken as the text to be encrypted.
                                                    changed cancel-input to be '@'.
                                                
                                                    cancelling midway of painttext or cyphertext inputting resulted in : main menu presented,
                                                    but quitting from main menu presents the main menu again, instead of quitting.
                                                    there was an if statement checking for both error code and cancel code, and it would
                                                    present main menu if the checks were matched. This was broken down to two if checks, and
                                                    no main menu was presented if cancel code or error code was detected. this fixed the issue.

    4   error value input to key        CLEAR       Had to add a try-except check to catch the value-error that happens when text font is input in
        -input was not handled                      place of the shift-number.
        
        
        
    5.1 Encrypt-right                   CLEAR       encrypt-right cyphertext was decoded backto the correct plaintext.
    5.2 Encrypt-left                    CLEAR       encrypt-left cyphertext was decoded backto the correct plaintext.
        
    6   Encrypt key ranges checked      CLEAR       only numbers from 01 to 99 allowed. but the number always has to be 2 digit. e.g. 02 or 09.
        
        
    7.1 Decrypt-right                   CLEAR       decrypted above cyphertext correctly
    7.2 Decrypt-left                    CLEAR       decrypted above cyphertext correctly
        
    8   Decrypt key ranges checked      CLEAR       only numbers from 01 to 99 allowed. but the number always has to be 2 digit. e.g. 02 or 09.
        
        
    9   Plain-text input checked        CLEAR       text input allows only alphabet characters and numbers, no space or symbols.
    10  Cypher-text input checked       CLEAR       text input allows only alphabet characters and numbers, no space or symbols. 
        
        
    11  numbers encryption              PARTLY      note: in a string of numbers, the order of numbers seems to be retained in the cypher text.
                                                    the order pattern is most visible if there is a string of digits, and is less visible when there 
                                                    are scattered digits.
        
                                                    also, the same cypher-number-string can be obtained at different multiples of 10.
                                                    e.g. key of 10r encrypting 1234 brings same result as, key of 30r encrypting 1234
                                                        this seems to only apply for number 10, maybe because there are 10 digits.
                                                        
        
    12  Help text comes up              CLEAR       help text added.
        
    13  About text comes up             CLEAR       about text added.
        
    14  comments                        CLEAR       the encryptor file was commented enough in the end.
